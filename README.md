# Kaholo Google Cloud Compute Engine Plugin
Google Cloud Compute Engine (GCCE) is a secure and customizable compute service that lets you create and run virtual machines on Googleâ€™s infrastructure.

## Access and Authentication
The gcloud CLI uses a set of service account keys (Credentials) and a project for access and authentication.

* Credentials - JSON format service account keys as downloaded from GCP, stored in Kaholo Vault.
* Project - text NAME of GCP project in which to work

When creating keys for a GCP service account, they can be downloaded in either JSON or P12 format. The JSON format is required for Kaholo plugins. Store the entire JSON document in a Kaholo Vault item. The Kaholo Vault allows them to be safely used without exposing the keys in log files, error messages, execution results, or any other output.

When pasting your GCP service account credentials into the Kaholo Vault, be careful to avoid line break issues. These happen when you cut from some text editors that use word wrap and then paste into Kaholo - newline characters get introduced. To avoid this either disable word-wrap or use another product that takes word-wrap into account when cutting/copying. If you have this issue the error when running a gcloud command looks something like this:

    Error : Error: ERROR: (gcloud.auth.activate-service-account) Could not read json file /tmp/tmp.GLezAM1EsF.json: Invalid \escape: line 1 column 764 (char 763)

GCP also organizes resources into named projects. The Project determines which assets you can see as well as various other project-level settings and permissions. Run command `gcloud projects list` to get a list of projects usable by your service account. The Project parameter is not required to run this command, only valid service account credentials are needed.

## Prerequisites
This plugin requires the following APIs to be enabled for your project(s) in the Google Cloud Platform:

>**Google Cloud Compute Engine API**
>
>**Identity and Access Management (IAM) API** *
>
>**Cloud Resource Manager API** **

APIs are enabled on a project-by-project basis. If you enabled an API recently, a few minutes may be required for the action to propagate to the systems and become fully effective.

\* The IAM API is needed only for autocomplete functionality of parameter Api Access Service Account in method Launch VM.

\*\* The Cloud Resource Manager API is needed only for autocomplete functionality of parameter Project.

## Plugin Installation
For download, installation, upgrade, downgrade and troubleshooting of plugins in general, see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## Settings
To access plugin settings, go to Settings | Plugins and click on the name of the plugin, which is a blue hyperlink. There you will find two tabs, "Settings" and "Accounts".

Plugin Settings act as default parameter values. If configured in plugin settings, the action parameters may be left unconfigured. This is an optional convenience. Action parameters configured anyway over-ride the plugin-level settings for that parameter.
* Default Project - A GCP Project defines how your app interacts with services and resources.
* Default Region - The geographical GCP region where infrastructure is or will be located, i.e. asia-southeast1.
* Default Disk Auto Delete - Choose whether or not disk is deleted when VM is deleted.
* Default Wait For Operation End - Wait for action to complete before moving to next action in the pipeline.

Plugin Accounts hold the authentication information used to access the Google APIs. If you have multiple sets of credentials you may create multiple accounts. Setting an account as default means new actions using this plugin will be created with the default account already selected, as a convenience.
* Credentials - JSON format service account keys as downloaded from GCP, stored in Kaholo Vault.

When creating keys for a GCP service account, they can be downloaded in either JSON or P12 format. The JSON format is required for Kaholo plugins. Store the entire JSON document in a Kaholo Vault item. The Kaholo Vault allows them to be safely used without exposing the keys in log files, error messages, execution results, or any other output.

Example GCP account credentials:

    {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "plugins-helm-alpha",
    "private_key_id": "a76cd5324c8dd3d65e3462343154cac43641b780",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n--verylong string--\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "plugins-helm-alpha-one@plugins-helm-alpha.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "1092104223900123456879",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/plugins-helm-alpha-one%40plugins-helm-alpha.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    }

## Method: Create Instance
This method creates a new virtual machine instance. The underlying Google Cloud API method is described [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/insert).

### Parameters
* Project - as described above in plugin settings
* Name - a name for the new VM instance
* Description - A description for the new VM instance
* Region - as described above in plugin settings
* Zone - Zone is a subdivision of GCP regions, typically region-a, b, or c.
* Machine Type - Machine Type determines type/quantity of vCPU, RAM, other features, and price, e.g. `e2-micro`
* Custom Machine CPU Count (only for custom machine types) - The desired number of vCPUs, e.g. `2`.
* Custom Machine Memory (only for custom machine types) - The amount of RAM in MB, e.g. `2048`.
* Image Project - The GCP project that contains the image you want to use for the boot disk of the new VM instance. Used only for autocompletion of the Image parameter.
* Image - The image you want to use for the boot disk of the new VM instance. This determines among other details which operating system is installed on the VM.
* Boot Disk Type - The type of disk to use for the boot disk - `PD-Standard`, `PD-Balanced`, `PD-SSD`, or `Local SSD`. The default value if not configured is `PD-Standard`.
* Boot Disk Size (GB) - The size of the boot disk. Default value is `10` GB.
* Disk Auto Delete - If enabled, when the new VM is deleted the disk will be also.
* Api Access Service Account - Provide the VM access to an API access service account.
* Service Account Access Scopes - Choose which level of access to grant the VM: `Allow default access` or `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`.
* Firewall - Allow HTTP traffic - If enabled, the VM is network tagged as `http-server` to allow inbound HTTP traffic. It will also create a similarly tagged firewall rule named `<vpcname>-allow-http`, unless a rule with that name already exists.
* Firewall - Allow HTTPS traffic - If enabled, the VM is network tagged as `https-server` to allow inbound HTTPS traffic. It will also create a similarly tagged firewall rule named `<vpcname>-allow-https`, unless a rule with that name already exists.
* Network service Tier - Choose the network service tier for the new VM's network adapter. The tier must be supported by the subnet the VM is using.
* VPC Network Name - The name of a VPC Network in the project with subnets in the specified region.
* Subnet - The name of a subnet within the VPC Network for the VM's default network interface.
* Custom Internal IP - If selected, assign this specified internal IP address for the new VM instance. Must be a valid IP address in the range of IP addresses of the subnet to host the VM instance.
* External IP - If defined, available, and falling within the allowed ranges, a specific external IP address may be assigned to the new VM.
* Reserved External Static IP Address Name - If an external static IP has already been created and is available, assign it to the new VM by providing its name here.
* Additional Network Interfaces - If selected, add additional network interfaces to the VM instance. Each interface must belong to a separate subnet. The format is an array, for example:

    `[{network: 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gcp-proj-a/global/networks/vpc-net-a', subnetwork: 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/gcp-proj-a/regions/asia-southeast1/subnetworks/sub-a', networkIP: '10.55.27.103'}]`

* Can IP Forward - If enabled, the VM instance can forward packets like a network device, e.g. NAT, router or firewall. Otherwise Google will block through packets due to strict source/destination checking.
* Preemptible - If enabled, the VM will be a discount-priced instance that may be arbitrarily deleted by GCP prematurely, or with 24 hours maximum.
* Tags - Network Tags associate Vms with firewall rules and routes with the same tag or tags. To enter multiple values seprate each with a new line.
* Labels - The `key=value` labels to assign to the new VM. To enter multiple values seprate each with a new line.
* Wait For Operation End - as described above in plugin settings

* Stop - Stops the VM.
* Start - Starts the VM.
* Restart - Stops and then Starts the VM.
* Get - Return a large collection of information about the VM instance as a JSON document in the Kaholo Execution Results Page, accessible by code as `kaholo.actions.<id of the get action>.result`
* Get External IP - Similar to Get, but returns simply the external IP address of the VM instance as string.
* Delete - Delete the VM instance.

### Parameters
* Project - as described above in plugin settings

* VM Instance - The name of the VM instance to delete.
* Wait For Operation End - as described above in plugin settings
* Delete Static IP - Whether you want to delete static IP associated with VM.

## Method: Create Subnet
Create a new subnet inside the specified VPC network. Unlike VPC networks, each subnet is located in one specific geographical region.

### Parameters
* Project - as described above in plugin settings
* VPC Network Name - the VPC network in which the subnet is to be created
* Subnet Name - a unique name for the new subnet
* Description - a description of the new subnet
* Region - as described above in plugin settings
* IP Range - CIDR notataion IP address range for the new subnet. For example 10.55.25.0/24.
* Private Google API Access - If selected, allow VM instances inside the new subnet to access any google API.
* Flow Logs - If selected, record subnet traffic to flow logs for network monitoring, forensics, real-time security analysis, and expense optimization.
* Wait For Operation End - as described above in plugin settings.

## Method: Reserve Private IP Address
Creates a reservation for the specified internal IP address on the specified subnet. This prevents the address from being arbitrarily assigned, for example to a new VM.

### Parameters
* Project - as described above in plugin settings
* VPC Network Name - the VPC network in which the reservation is to be created
* Region - as described above in plugin settings
* Subnet - the subnet in which the reservation is to be created
* Reservation name - a name for the reservation.
* IP To Reserve - the IP address to reserve. This must fall within the defined CIDR address space of the subnet.
* Wait For Operation End - as described above in plugin settings.

## Method: Create Firewall Rule
Creates a new firewall rule for the specified VPC network. Rules can contain ranges of IP addresses and ports, but each rule must be for either all traffic or one specified protocol and either ingress or egress. Create multiple rules if necessary to cover all combinations of protocol and ingress/egress requried. **The defaults are very permissive** - if none of the optional parameters are specified, the method creates by default a rule that allows all traffic from everywhere into the subnet. This is for Kaholo user convenience only, not an advisable security practice.

Rules are associated to routes and VM instances by means of Network Tags. For example a firewall rule to allow TCP ingress on port 443 (HTTPS) tagged `https-server` would allow only VM instances also tagged `https-server` to receive HTTPS web traffic. Firewall rules with no tags apply to every VM instance in the VPC network.

### Parameters
* Project - as described above in plugin settings
* VPC Network Name - the VPC network in which the firewall rule is to be created
* Firewall Name - A name for the new firewall rule.
* Priority - The priority of the new firewall rule. Default is 1000
    * 0 = highest priority
    * 65535 = lowest priority
* Direction - The direction of the firewall rule. Possible values:
    * Ingress - filter incoming network traffic (default)
    * Egress - filter outgoing network traffic
* Action - typically there's a catch-all deny rule and higher priority allow rules for a list of exceptions.
    * Allow - permit traffic that matches the rule (default)
    * Deny - block traffic that matches the rule
* Ip Range Filter - The IP ranges the new firewall rule will be applied to. The default is 0.0.0.0/0 - *every* IP address.
* Protocol - Which protocol the rules apply to if not all.
    * All - rule applies to every protocol, every port
    * AH, ESP, IPIP - no ports required
    * ICMP - typically used to allow ping, no ports required 
    * SCTP, UDP - ports are typically specified for these
    * TCP - the most commonly specified protocol, also used with ports
* Ports - Port or port ranges to match for firewall rules using TCP, UDP, or SCTP. Enter one port or port range per line, no commas. If not defined the rule matches every port. Commonly used examples with TCP include:
    * no port specified - allow every TCP port
    * `22` - SSH (Linux)
    * `80` - HTTP
    * `443` - HTTPS
    * `3389` - Remote Desktop (Windows)
    * `1025-65535` - Range matching all ephemeral addresses
* Wait For Operation End - as described above in plugin settings.
* Tags - Network tags to to associate the firewall rule with similarly tagged VM instances.

## Method: Create Route
Create a new route inside the specified network. This directs traffic both between subnets and peering with internet gateways, VPN tunnels, load balancers, firewall instances and such. Like firewall rules, routes also accept network tags. Network tags are used to match routes with VM instances that bear the same network tag. For example a route to the internet gateway tagged `internet` would allow only VM instances also tagged `internet` access to the internet. Routes with no tags apply to every VM instance in the VPC network.

### Parameters
* Project - as described above in plugin settings
* VPC Network Name - the VPC network in which the route is to be created
* Route Name - The name of the new route.
* Next Hop IP - The route's destination IP address, aka gateway address.
* Dest IP Range - The range of destination IP addresses in CIDR notation to which this route applies.
* Priority - The priority of the new route. Default is 1000
    * 0 = highest priority
    * 65535 = lowest priority
* Tags - Network tags to to associate the route with similarly tagged VM instances.
* Wait For Operation End - as described above in plugin settings.

## Method: List Subnets
Lists all subnets in the specified VPC network.
### Parameters
* Project - as described above in plugin settings
* Region - as described above in plugin settings
* VPC Network Name - the VPC network in which the reservation is to be created
